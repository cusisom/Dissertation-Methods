# Photogrammetry Workflow

## Photogrammetry and Slicer Workflow for 3D Geometric Morphometrics
This workflow walks through the process of digitizing skeletal materials via photogrammetry for geometric morphometric analysis in 3D Slicer.

### Software:

Foldio 360

Adobe Lightroom

Reality Capture
 
3D Slicer

	Extensions: Slicer IGT & SlicerMorph
	
### Hardware:

Foldio smart turntable and lightbox

Canon EOS 6D DSLR camera

### Photogrammetry

#### The focus of this section is on capturing data to develop three dimensional models in the Reality Capture software. This walkthrough is a step-by-step guide designed for unfamiliar users. 

1. Turn on the foldio equipment and camera to initialize Bluetooth link between turntable and camera

2. Ensure that the light box is turned on and the fluorescent room lights re turned off

3. Open foldio app on smartphone

* Select DSLR 360 from the device information screen
* Click on Select Device at bottom of screen
  - Foldio 360 should appear as an option
     - Open Select Camera Brand menu and select Canon (either one)
	 - Under settings select IR remote delay and set to 2 seconds
     - On main screen, set number of shots to 36 (you will see the default of 24 on the display. Click this once to change to 36)
	 
4. Set the camera to Av 
   - Set the white balance to Color Temperature (hit the Q menu button and scroll through 	options until you see white balance)
   - Set camera to manual focus

5. Place specimen in the center of the turntable
   - Use a stand/ring mold
   
   - If this is a skull, set the beginning position as close to Frankfurt horizontal as possible. 
   
6. Focus camera on specimen. For best precision, use the magnifying glass button on camera to zoom over focused region. 

7. Once all settings are in place, press the orange button on the foldio app to begin shooting.
	* _Do not close the app or return to home screen on phone. This will stop the process._ 
	
8. Wait until all 36 photos have been taken. Then rotate antero-superiorly (rotate along sagittal plane)
	- To capture all need angles you will need to reposition the skull about 6 times, rotating it approximately 30 degrees in the sagittal plane each time. Your last set of photos should be shot with the frontal bone positioned in the ring mold. 

9. Remove the memory card from the camera and load into Adobe Lightroom on computer

## Lightroom

1. To view photos, click on import and choose the USB drive
   - Find DCIM under 100 Canon
   - Make sure that only the photos that you want imported are selected
   - Click import
 
2. Once photos are imported, click on develop in top right corner
 - This will open full view of first photo in the list
3. Click on the eyedropper icon on the right side of the screen and then click on the photo
   - From this window you can also adjust the texture of the file. Increase a bit for more detail but not so much that it begins to highlight details other than the crania (e.g., aspects of the turntable or specimen stand)
4. When settings are as you want them, click on copy in the bottom left corner. Click ok on the menu that pops up.
   - Then hold control and press ‘a’ to select the entire library.
   - Click sync in the bottom right corner to apply to all
   - You can switch back to library view from the menu in the top right corner to see if Lightroom is applying your changes to all photos.
5. When complete, hit Export in bottom left corner and choose a folder to send the images. 
 
## Reality Capture

1. Open Reality Capture
2. Under Workflow in the ribbon on top should have an icon that says Folder, click on this and select the folder that your exported photos are in.
3. Check to see that the images loaded by observing the image count in the window on the left of the screen
4. Click on the Alignment tab in the ribbon and find the Align Images button
	- Wait while the program creates your model
	
      - *The resulting image can vary in its presentation. In any case, it will look like a pixelated model of your specimen. If it looks like your specimen in multiple views (i.e., the images didn’t create one cohesive model) you will need to add more photos or begin the process again. If the images come together to create what looks like a good rendition of the specimen you can move on.* 
	  
-To orient the model, click on the Tools button in the SCENE 3D ribbon. At the very left of the ribbon menu there are two buttons for setting the Reconstruction Region and the Ground Plane. Begin by clicking ‘Set Ground Plane’
	-You will observe three colored rings and three colored bars appear within your model.
	-Clicking on any of the colored rings will allow you to rotate your model. Do this until it 	is in proper anatomical position (for crania, position in Frankfurt Horizontal). 
	-Once in the correct position, click on the vertical colored bar to drag the model up to 	place on the ground plane. 
-Click on the Set Reconstruction Region tab in the top left menu
	-A bounding box will appear around your model. Make sure that this box encompasses 	your entire model (nothing outside the box)
Setting Scale
-Once the model is properly oriented, move to establishing the correct scale.
-Under the Tools tab in SCENE 3D, click on the ‘Control Points’ tab
	-A menu will appear on the left of the screen
	-Click on the button that says Create
		-It will generate an unassigned point (point 0)
	-A small pop-up window will appear in the upper right corner of your screen suggesting 	that control points be assigned in 2D mode. Heed this advice.
		-Near where this pop-up appeared (top right of model viewer screen) is a small 			white box that reads ‘3Ds’. Click and hold this button to access the dropdown 			menu.
		-Open the 2Ds library
		*Important. You will need to choose at least 2 different photos to set the control 			points. If you pressed ‘Test Connection’ on the foldio app when taking photos, 			you will likely have at least two copies of the first image. Do not use the duplicate 		shot when setting control points. 
		-Click on the first image you want to use and open the drop down menu again.
			-Click on 2D, to view this image
			-Click on the point 0 button that generated earlier. You can now place this 				point on your image. 
			-After this point is placed, generate another unassigned point by clicking 				create. This will give you ‘point 1’
			-Select this unassigned point and place it on the image.
		*There is no protocol yet for what points to use. I am using the nasal aperture 			height as my metric for setting scale. Thus, I am setting point 0 at the distal-most 			aspect of the nasal bones, and point 1 at the tip of the anterior nasal spine 				(subspinale)
			-Return to the 2Ds library and click on the second image. Being sure to 				select the correct points (first point 0, then point 1), assign the points to the 			corresponding positions on this image.
		-To set your scale, you will first need to know the distance between these two 			points. Collect this distance manually on the physical specimen with sliding 			calipers. 
		-In Reality Capture, under Tools in the SCENE 3D menu, select Define Distance
			-Click on point 0 in one of your 2D images and drag to point 1
			-A box will appear in the menu on the left of your screen (Selected 					Constraint(s))
			-Reality Capture will provide you with a Defined Distance that does not 				look accurate. Delete the number provided for you and type in the 					measurement that you collected manually. **Note that Reality Capture 				insists on the scale being in meters. If your measurement is in Millimeters 				(should be), make sure to properly convert the measurement. 
	-Once your distance is defined, go back to the Alignment Menu from the top ribbon.
		-Click on Update
		-If everything went right, this will quickly update the scale for your model
Finishing the Model
-To finish the model making process, return to the Mesh Model Menu
	-Click on the Normal Detail button.
	-This will take a minute
