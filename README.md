# Dissertation Methods Learning

I'm using this repository to consolidate, track, and build on my understanding of the methods I will need to employ throughout my dissertation. The primary aspects of my project that require new methodology are Phylogentic Reconstruction and Trait Determination, Analysis of Variance and Species Delimitation, and possible investigation in Vicariance.
